Assignment | API for converting the csv to json in desired format

## Welcome to Assignment

Here is the assignment for the day.

### For Processing the CSV Data

I have stored it in the assets folder.

For converting the CSV to desired JSON, please follow the steps below:

1. **Step 1:** Upload the CSV file in the assets folder.
2. **Step 2:** Update the path in the `.env` file or the environment variable:
    ```plaintext
    For Example:
    csvPath=folder/demofile-1.csv
    PORT=3000
    ```
3. **Step 3:** Start the node server.
4. **Step 4:** Hit the POST method from Postman or any client to `/process`.
5. **Step 5:** The script will process the data and insert it into the SQLite DB.
6. **Step 6:** After inserting, the SQL will run and output the desired result as "Distribution of user as per Age Group".

Thanks.
